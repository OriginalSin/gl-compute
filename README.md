# gl-compute

## WebGL Compute Framework

An attempt at creating a compute framework on top of WebGL. Based on some [Stack.gl](stack.gl) modules. There are projects alike, but either they require indepth knowledge of OpenGL to base projects of, they are too inflexible or they are too tied with a specific usage ([webclgl](https://github.com/stormcolor/webclgl) / [webgl-matrix-demo](https://github.com/watmough/webgl-matrix-demo) / [three.js - gpgpu flocking](http://jabtunes.com/labs/3d/gpuflocking/webgl_gpgpu_flocking6.html)).

Disclaimer: this is an hobbyist approach, don't let my code bad practices deceive you.
